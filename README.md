# JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs
## Overview of Project
> Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

2. ***Deliverable 2***: A written report on the UFO analysis [`README.md`]

# Deliverable 1:  
## Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your `index.html` file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the image.

### Results with detail analysis:

1. **The list element that creates the button is removed, and there are five list elements for filtering in the `index.html` file.**

2. **The event listener is modified to detect changes to each filter in the `app.js` file.**

3. ​**The `updateFilters()` function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed.**

4. **The `filterTable()` function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matches the filter values.**

# Deliverable 2: 
## A written report on the UFO analysis
### Deliverable Requirements:
For your written analysis, be sure to use complete and coherent sentences. Your written analysis should contain three sections, which cover the following:

1. **Overview of Project:** Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
2. **Results:** Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
3. **​Summary:** In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.


 
### Results with detail analysis:


1. **Overview of Project:** Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

2. **Results:** Let’s describe step by step how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria. Using images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

3. ​**​Summary:** In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.


> Drawback:

One drawback is, the text has to be exact in order for the search to work.

> Recommendations:

Having cleaner data will help the tables be better looking and having dropdown boxes will help in the text not having to be an exact match.
